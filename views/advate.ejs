            <p>The Haemophilia Society is an active support group for people with haemophilia and their families, and provides lots of up-to-date information and individual support on the management and treatment of haemophilia, and about living with the condition. Many people with haemophilia gain great support from other patients. The Society also offers a unique opportunity for people affected by haemophilia to get in touch with other people in similar circumstances.</p>
