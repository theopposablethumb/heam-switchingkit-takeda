      <h1>ADYNOVI<sup>&reg;</sup>&#9660 (rurioctocog alfa pegol) – for the treatment of haemophilia A in adults and children over 12 years of age</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the ADYNOVI patient website.</p>
      <p>Your haemophilia treatment centre has provided you with access to this Takeda-developed website because they have prescribed ADYNOVI for you as a treatment or a preventative treatment (prophylaxis) for haemophilia A.</p>
      <p>ADYNOVI is an ‘extended half-life’ (or EHL) factor VIII treatment.</p>
      <p>Other treatments for haemophilia A called ‘standard half-life’ (or SHL) factor VIII, stay in the blood for a relatively shorter time compared with EHL treatments. SHL factor treatments require repeat injections for prophylaxis (every 2-3 days for haemophilia A).</p>
      <p>ADYNOVI contains the active substance rurioctocog alfa pegol (pegylated human coagulation factor VIII). It has been modified to prolong its duration of action. This means that ADYNOVI stays in the blood for longer than with an SHL treatment and may reduce the number of injections needed.</p>
      <p>Here you will find information about haemophilia (including symptoms and key facts), support regarding your treatment with ADYNOVI, and sources of further advice and information.</p>

            <p>The Haemophilia Society is an active support group for people with haemophilia and their families, and provides lots of up-to-date information and individual support on the management and treatment of haemophilia, and about living with the condition. Many people with haemophilia gain great support from other patients. The Society also offers a unique opportunity for people affected by haemophilia to get in touch with other people in similar circumstances.</p>

            <h2>We Bleed Differently</h2>
            <p>The We Bleed Differently (WBD) campaign has been initiated and funded by Takeda, and developed together with The Haemophilia Society.</p>
            <p>We Bleed Differently is a campaign to provide practical support tools for people with bleeding disorders and their care teams. We want to support people with bleeding disorders and healthcare professionals to have the discussions that enable people with bleeding disorders to live the life they want to. Takeda is delighted to be partnering with The Haemophilia Society in this campaign and their ongoing work to support, inform and inspire all members of the bleeding disorder community.</p>
