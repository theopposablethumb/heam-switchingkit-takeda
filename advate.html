                <h2>The Haemophilia Society</h2>
                <p>The Haemophilia Society is an active support group for people with haemophilia and their families, and provides lots of up-to-date information and individual support on the management and treatment of haemophilia, and about living with the condition. Many people with haemophilia gain great support from other patients. The Society also offers a unique opportunity for people affected by haemophilia to get in touch with other people in similar circumstances.</p>

                <p>The We Bleed Differently (WBD) campaign has been initiated and funded by Takeda, and developed together with The Haemophilia Society.</p>
                <p>We Bleed Differently is a campaign to provide practical support tools for people with bleeding disorders and their care teams. We want to support people with bleeding disorders and healthcare professionals to have the discussions that enable people with bleeding disorders to live the life they want to. Takeda is delighted to be partnering with The Haemophilia Society in this campaign and their ongoing work to support, inform and inspire all members of the bleeding disorder community.</p>
