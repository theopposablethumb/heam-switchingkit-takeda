          <h1>Resources for people living with haemophilia</h1>
          <p>Haemophilia is a complex disorder and you may have lots of questions about your condition, both when you are first diagnosed and also throughout your life with haemophilia.</p>
          <p>Your haemophilia treatment centre and the Haemophilia Society are here to support you. Takeda UK have also developed the following resources to help you and your caregivers learn more about haemophilia.</p>
          <p><strong>The guides below cover both haemophilia A and B and therefore, not all the information may be applicable to your condition.</strong></p>
